<div style=float:none>
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov">HackingMaterials group</a> at <a href="https://lbl.gov">LBL</a>. <b>I use computers to help find and design new materials;</b> I develop machine learning pipelines, run quantum-mechanical simulations, and develop open source software to help others do the same. I also work alongside the <a href=https://materialsproject.org>Materials Project</a>, an online resarch effort with over 100,000 registered users.
