# My CV



## I like data science and scientific computing. 
#### (And sometimes both of them together) 

{{% figure src="/headshot_professional.jpg#floatright" %}}
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [HackingMaterials group](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov) at [LBL](https://lbl.gov) which works closely alongside the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org). I use computers to help find and design new materials using data science and _ab-initio_ calculations.

# Experience

1. **Graduate Student Research Assistant @ LBNL.**  Using data-mining to elucidate structure-property relationships and accelerate predictions of material properties. Running many thousands of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate candidate thermoelectrics, communicating results to experimental collaborators. Writing open-source software packages for data mining materials properties and running massively parallel calculations on supercomputers. (_2017 -_ present)

2. **Consultant @ MaterialsQM Consulting.** High-throughput synthesis pathway screening using density functional theory and combinatorics. Communicating with clients, preparing reports, and helping guide discovery of novel semiconductor materials. (_2018 - 2019_)

3. **Undergraduate Student Research Assistant @ LBNL.** Remote position. Wrote a black-box Bayesian optimization (adaptive design) package for use with the workflow software FireWorks. Incorporated several machine learning algorithms as optimization engines, and tested the performance on two example use cases in materials science. (_2016 - 2017_)

4. **Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Researcher @ UCLA.** Studied on-chip microscopy at the Ozcan Lab. Investigated techniques for rapidly polymerizing nanolenses inside mobile microscopes to identify nanoparticles (such as viruses). (_2015 - 2016_)

5. **Lead App Designer @ UCLA Dept. of Anesthesiology Mobile App Team.** Lead UX design for a mobile application for perioperative/anesthetic care for UCLA Health. Worked alongside the UCLA Health Center to develop a comprehensive program for wireless bioinformatics. (_2015 - 2016_)
