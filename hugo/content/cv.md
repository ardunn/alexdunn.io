# My CV/Resume



### I do data science and scientific computing. 
#### (And sometimes both of them together) 

Right now, I develop new machine learning approaches and high-throughput computational tools to accelerate discovery of novel materials (particularly for energy applications) - or in not so many words, I use computers to help find and design new materials.

I'm part of the [HackingMaterials group](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov) at LBL which works closely alongside the [Materials Project](materialsproject.org). Oh, and I'm a big fan of free and open source software, blockchain tech, and just programming, in general. Check out my abbreviated CV below, if you're into that sort of thing... if you want the full version, shoot me an email.
