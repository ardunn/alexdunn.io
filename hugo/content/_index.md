I'm Alex, a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. I develop new machine learning approaches and high-throughput computational tools to accelerate discovery of novel materials (particularly for energy applications) - or in not so many words, I use computers to help find and design new materials. I'm part of the [HackingMaterials group](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov) at LBL which works closely alongside the [Materials Project](materialsproject.org).
