If you lived in Northern California during the December of 2021, you may have noticed the torrential downpour causing [thousands of downed trees, multi-week power outages](https://www.abc10.com/article/weather/severe-weather/nevada-city-winter-storm/103-6357e736-9d75-4071-b57b-54cf9a6ec1bd), and general mayhem. Up here in the mountains, we received the [snowiest December on record and the third-snowiest month of all time](https://www.sierrasun.com/news/december-snowfall-record-smashed/). We, of course, took advantage of this snowpocalypse with some dives off of our deck - normally a 15-20ft drop to the ground - which went semi-viral on Nextdoor and [made our local Moonshine Ink newspaper](https://www.moonshineink.com/think-local/deepcember21/).
