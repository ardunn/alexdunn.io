The posts section on this website are an elcectic collection of my non-work interests, experiments, and thoughts. Generally what's here is related to computing, technology, science, or mathematics, but not strictly so! 

If you are hoping to learn more about the research I've worked on, my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SqGIG_wAAAAJ&hl=en) is the best place for that; if you're looking for the code I've contributed to, check out the Github pages of the academic organizations I've worked with: [HackingMaterials](https://github.com/hackingmaterials), [Materials Intelligence](https://github.com/materialsintelligence), and the [Materials Project](https://github.com/materialsproject). 


If you have thoughts on any of the posts, please email me.
