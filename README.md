## how this site is built

This site is built primarily with `hugo`, a static site generator. I used the template of the [black-and-white](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/hugo-black-and-light-theme) theme and modified the templates and partial html snippets for a different appearance. Compiled with hugo v0.54.0.
