      <description>My CV/Resume I do data science and scientific computing. (And sometimes both of them together) Right now, I develop new machine learning approaches and high-throughput computational tools to accelerate discovery of novel materials (particularly for energy applications) - or in not so many words, I use computers to help find and design new materials.
I&amp;rsquo;m part of the HackingMaterials group at LBL which works closely alongside the Materials Project.</description>
