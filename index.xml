      <description>CalGradData: Interactive Visualization of Cal Graduate Financial Data Recently the UC Berkeley Graduate Assembly put out a call for a Data Visualization contest of UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s graduate financial data. I think their motivation was to take the most boring data on the planet and transform it into an engaging and interesting form. Whether they succeeded or not, only time will tell.
Well my friend (and fellow graduate student) John Dagdelen and I decided to put our HTML, CSS, JS, and Plotly Dash skills to use in making an interactive website for this otherwise bone dry data.</description>

      <description>TOC:  Motivation Step A: Requirements Step B: Physical setup and formatting Step C: Mounting and configuration Step D: Test out your new time machine Maintenance and Conclusions  Motivation I have a Macbook Pro (2017) dedicated exclusively to my work as a graduate student. If I lost it and had no backup, i would be uttely devastated. Having a backup is an absolute necessity - as the saying goes:</description>

      <title>Halls of Software Fame and Shame</title>

      <description>TOC:  What is this? The Hall of Fame The Hall of Shame  What is this? Much as great literature, high art, or great music deserves praise, so does software. And I mean software in all of its forms - from robust bash scripts which hide in the internet&amp;rsquo;s shadows, to the expansive open-source projects known the world over, to weirdly helpful websites which refuse to run ads, and even to a select few high-gloss corporate products.</description>

      <description>TOC:  Introduction Step A: Configure SSH Access Step B: Configure automatic backups with crontab and rsync Step C: Easily mount your Pi with SSHFS Step D (optional): Configure access outside the local network Step E (optional): Configure a samba share Maintenance and Conclusions  For $35, the Raspberry Pi is an incredible single board computer. You can connect to the internet, run Linux, automate your home, or make a robot - the list goes on and on.</description>

      <description>The posts section on this website are an electic collection of my non-work interests, experiments, and thoughts. Generally what&amp;rsquo;s here is related to computing, technology, science, or mathematics, but not strictly so!
If you are hoping to learn more about the research I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, my Google Scholar is the best place for that; if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the code I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to, check out the Github pages of the academic organizations I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with: HackingMaterials, Materials Intelligence, and the Materials Project.</description>

      <description>My CV   Scientific computing and data science. (And sometimes both together)            Last updated: 2019.12.02
I&#39;m a Ph.D. candidate in the HackingMaterials group at LBL. I use computers to help find and design new materials; I develop machine learning pipelines, run quantum-mechanical simulations, and develop open source software to help others do the same. I also work alongside the Materials Project, an online resarch effort with over 100,000 registered users.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a short list of recent - and relatively self-contained - software projects I&amp;rsquo;ve created, led, or principally developed.

Work projects automatminer  Github Docs Publication: coming soon  Automatminer is an automatic, general purpose machine learning pipeline for predicting the properties of materials. It works for most materials datasets and includes aspects of AutoML, transfer learning, and reproducible benchmarking (through our benchmark Matbench, analagous to ImageNet for image classification).</description>
