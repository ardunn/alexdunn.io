      <description>CalGradData: Interactive Visualization of Cal Graduate Financial Data Recently the UC Berkeley Graduate Assembly put out a call for a Data Visualization contest of UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s graduate financial data. I think their motivation was to take the most boring data on the planet and transform it into an engaging and interesting form. Whether they succeeded or not, only time will tell.
Well my friend (and fellow graduate student) John Dagdelen and I decided to put our HTML, CSS, JS, and Plotly Dash skills to use in making an interactive website for this otherwise bone dry data.</description>

      <description>TOC:  What is this? The Hall of Fame The Hall of Shame  What is this? Much as great literature, high art, or great music deserves praise, so does software. And I mean software in all of its forms - from robust bash scripts which hide in the internet&amp;rsquo;s shadows, to the expansive open-source projects known the world over, to weirdly helpful websites which refuse to run ads, and even to a select few high-gloss corporate products.</description>

      <description>The posts section on this website are an electic collection of my non-work interests, experiments, and thoughts. Generally what&amp;rsquo;s here is related to computing, technology, science, or mathematics, but not strictly so!
If you are hoping to learn more about the research I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, my Google Scholar is the best place for that; if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the code I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to, check out the Github pages of the academic organizations I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with: HackingMaterials, Materials Intelligence, and the Materials Project.</description>
